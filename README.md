## Message of the Day
Merry Christmas, everyone! We're excited to announce the grand reopening of the Family Guy DarkRP server. It's been a challenging two years since our initial reopening, but we're proud to bring back the infamous Family Guy DarkRP.

### What's New
#### First of All
We've added a plethora of cool new weapons to the server, including lightsabers, Star Wars guns, more m9k items, a variety of new zero's stuff, UWeed, a new Hud, and Tab Menu that no longer lags the game.

#### Second
We've bid farewell to the small map rp_simplytown. While it served us well, it was time for a change. A big thank you to those who supported us during its duration and contributed to our growth.

#### Third
We're changing how the MOTD works. Instead of being greeted by the server rules, you will now encounter a new Message of the Day board with three buttons at the top: Rules, How to Play, Discord, and Store.

- **Rules:** Guides you on what you can and cannot do.
- **How to Play:** Provides guidance on starting and playing the game, serving as a refresher or a guide for specific roles.
- **Discord:** Links you to our Discord page.
- **Store:** An optional button for supporting the community through purchases or sales.

#### Last but Not Least
We want to honor our old staff who helped shape the community we are today. Although they've moved on to greater endeavors, if you come across them on other servers, give them a shoutout! Here are some of them:
