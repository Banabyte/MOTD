## Happy Holidays Everyone
I've just wanted to let you guys know, we've took the time to prepare this server.<br>
In under 3 days, We've created Family Guy DarkRP V6 (Codenamed: Family Guy DarkRP Returns)<br>

## So Whats new?
### The Map
For the longest period of time, we've been playing on rp_simplytown_v2. So, it was time for a changeup in maps, Your now playing on rp_downtown_modern.<br>

### Weapon Packs
For the longest period of time, we've strictly stuck to m9k for the longest period of time. It was great, but not fun for all players to enjoy.<br>
So we've been mixing and matching to the community's like. For Example: Star Wars Weapons, Lightsavers, CS:GO Knifes, and m9k. (if you have a suggestion please leave it in the discord server so we can review and add it into the server)<br>

### Vehicals
Yes Vehicals, we're adding back vehical packsm into the server. (due to the size of the map, we're going to return sales of vehicals)<br>

### Jobs
We've currently added brand new jobs into the server for Example<br>
  - PyroTechnic
  - Weed Grower
  - Meth Master
  - Mayor West
  - Officer Joe (no longer seperate)
  - And so much more will be added soon

### RNG Battle system (MMOStyle)
A new system is now being introduced to the server which is an RNG based Battle Style.<br>
Players will now have dodge and random crits registered in the system.<br>

Players will have a 35% chance of dodging PvP attacks <br>
Players will also have a 12% chance at dealing critical damage in Pvp Combat <br>

### Loading Screen
The loading screen has been changed to a holiday theme for a temporary amount of time.<br>

### Economics
Players will start with 300k Dollars to spend around the town<br>
Players will also recive double salary durring the holidays <br>
