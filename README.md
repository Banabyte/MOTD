## Happy Holidays Everyone!

I'm thrilled to share some exciting news with you all. We've dedicated time to enhance the server experience, and in just under 3 days, we proudly present Family Guy DarkRP V6, codenamed Family Guy DarkRP Returns.

## What's New?

### The Map
After spending considerable time on `rp_simplytown_v2`, it was time for a fresh map. You're now exploring `rp_downtown_modern`.

### Weapon Packs
We've expanded beyond the long-standing use of `m9k` to cater to diverse player preferences. Expect a mix, including Star Wars Weapons, Lightsabers, CS:GO Knives, and `m9k`. Have a suggestion? Share it on the Discord server for review and possible addition.

### Vehicles
Yes, vehicles are making a comeback! Due to the map size, vehicle packs are returning, and sales of vehicles will resume.

### Jobs
Explore new additions to the job list, such as:
- Pyrotechnic
- Weed Grower
- Meth Master
- Mayor West
- Officer Joe (now integrated)
And more exciting roles will be introduced soon.

### RNG Battle System (MMO Style)
A new RNG-based battle system is now part of the server. Expect dodge and random crits during PvP combat, with a 35% chance of dodging attacks and a 12% chance of dealing critical damage.

### Loading Screen
Enjoy a holiday-themed loading screen for a limited time.

### Economics
To kickstart your in-game economy:
- Players begin with 300k Dollars.
